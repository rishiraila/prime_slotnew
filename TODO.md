# TODO for Modifying Pending Meetings Endpoint

- [x] Create new endpoint file: src/app/api/members/meetings/pending/route.js
- [x] Modify code to use user.uid as memberId, restrict to member mode, remove params and mismatch checks
- [x] Test the new endpoint by running the server and making a request (server started on port 3001)
